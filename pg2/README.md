Northern Michigan University (Marquette Co, MI)
CS 344-01-16F: iOS / iPhone Programming
# Program 2
Due: Friday 16 September 2016 1:00 P.M. EDT
# Simple App

Create a folder called “PG2” in the top level of your CS344-01-16F folder. Copy your XCode
project file into this folder. Place a (possibly empty) file or folder called “DONE” into this
folder when you are ready to have your programs graded.
Generate an app using only the storyboard without writing a single bit of manual code. This app
can be on a topic of your choice but you should have at least ten different views that you can
move around between with buttons. Make it reasonably cool.
